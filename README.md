# zacharius-harris-portfolio
I’m Zacharius Harris, an IT graduate with a strong interest in programming and software development. I have hands-on experience with Visual Basic, Python, and JavaScript, and I enjoy building small, practical projects that solve everyday problems and demonstrate clean, efficient code.

My background includes nearly a decade of work at Dollar General Warehouse, where I developed strong problem-solving skills, attention to detail, and a disciplined work ethic — all of which I now apply to my programming journey.

I’m currently expanding my portfolio to pursue an entry-level software or programming role, with a focus on continuous learning and real-world application.
